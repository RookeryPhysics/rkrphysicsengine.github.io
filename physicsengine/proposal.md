##Physics Engine
-A physics engine that can simulate gravity, collisions between objects, buoyancy, orbital trajectories, and ideally much more. It will have an easy to use interface for creating objects and setting their parameters as well as tweaking with the laws of physics themselves. If I have time I will use some of the scenarios to create games.
##Needs to have
-surface gravity
-realistic collision resolution for balls
-static bodies
-orbital trajectories
-buoyancy with objects that float and objects that sink
-interface that allows user to spawn objects
-options page to pick gravity
##Nice to have
-"real" orbital Physics(Newtonian Mechanics)
-solar system creator
-realistic collision resolution(squares, rectangles, triangles)
-air resistance
-pendulum
